## x) Read and summarize

## [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02)

- Protocols are a series of steps involving two or more parties designed to accomplish a task.
- Protocols can be put into three different categories: arbitrated (involving a trusted third party), adjudicated (involving a third party only in case of disputes), and self-enforcing (protocols that ensure fairness without third-party involvement).
- One-way hash functions are important for data integrity and public-key cryptography.
- If you were to use symmetric cryptography, it's difficult to make sure that the secret key doesn't get leaked. Public-key cryptography uses two keys, making communication much safer.
- Digital signatures are better than even a hand written signature due to public-key cryptography.
- Using digital signatures with encryption, we are able to get privacy and proof of authorship.
- It's important to use random and pseudo-random sequence generation in cryptography, since computers can't generate truly random numbers on their own. For higher security standards, we aim for sequences that are difficult to predict and difficult to reproduce.

## a) Installing Hashcat

In this exercise I used [Tero's guide](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/) to crack passwords with Hashcat.

First I installed Hashcat by typing the following into the terminal in my virtual box that is running debian:

After that I created a directory called hashed:

After that I got the rockyou dictionary:

Then I used the 'tar' command which stands for tape archive, and is used to create archive and extract the archive files:

In order to identify the hash type I run this command:
