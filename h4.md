## x) Read and summarize

### [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/08_chap01.html#chap01-sec001)

- Encryption disguises plaintext into ciphertext and decryption reverses this process.
- There are two categories of algorithms; symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric algorithms use the key, for both encryption and decryption while asymmetric algorithms use one key for encryption and another one for decryption.
- The security of an algorithm relies on the secrecy of the key, not the secrecy of the algorithm itself. The idea of keeping the algorithm public but not disclosing the key is key.
- Cryptanalysis aims to uncover either the plaintext or the key used for encryption without having access, to the decryption key. Common types of attacks include ciphertext attacks, known plaintext attacks and chosen plaintext attacks.
- Steganography is also mentioned, it is about concealing the existence of a message within another seemingly innocuous message or medium.

Comment: The security of an encryption method should not depend on its algorithm being secret, but rather on the secrecy of its key. This allows for widespread scrutiny and improvement of cryptographic methods.

### [[Disobey 2023] Don't Trust the Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iluhSh4E2r8)

- The video discusses the potential risks and issues related to URL scanning in particular cases where the scan results become public, using urlscan.io as an example.
- Some of the main issues highlighted include the unintentional public exposure of phishing URLs, marketing emails, and secure mail systems.
- There are real-world examples of legal documents and personal data being leaked due to the public nature of the scan results.
- The speaker (Markus Lehtonen) emphasizes that it is not always the fault of the companies that have their data leaked, as this can sometimes happen due to users scanning links without realizing the implication.
- He goes on to propose solutions to these issues, mainly targeted at the developers - not including any sensitive data in the URLs, implementing additional security measures, and modeling and reviewing threats.
- The video ends with a discussion on related research and mentions that the company behind urlscan.io is aware of the problems outlined. The company's response was that it's the nature of how their platform operates and they're working on rectifications.

## a) Encrypt and decrypt a message. 

I followed [this](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/) tutorial by Tero.

So first things first: I installed the GNU privacy guard by typing this line into the terminal:

Then I generated a keypair by typing this into the terminal:

After that I need to create a user ID to identify my key. That is done by entering a name, and an email address:
