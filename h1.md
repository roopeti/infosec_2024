## Summary on episode 92 of the Darknet Diaries, featuring The Pirate Bay

- The Pirate Bay became the largest piracy search engine on the Internet, making it easy for people to share digital content such as movies, music, games and books.
- One of the co-founders Peter Sunde was interviewed and he shared his views on the legal and moral aspects of piracy. He said that the current copyright laws are unjust and that he prioritizes moral principles over legality.
- The host of the podcast, Jack Rhysider compared The Pirate Bay to Spotify, saying that services like Spotify are not available in all countries, which limits access to entertainment for those who cannot afford it. Suggesting The Pirate Bay as an alternative.
- This episode touches on the idea that the music industry was still profitable during the height of piracy. This shows that the current copyright system may not be the best for artist to monetize their content.
- The Pirate Bay did not respond to requests from the media industry to remove any content.
- Nor did The Pirate Bay make any significant profit. The ads that The Pirate Bay has barely cover the operational costs.
- The platform has remained mostly unchanged since a rebuild around 2004-2005.

## Summary of the paper discussing intelligence-driven Computer Network Defence (CND)

- It is suggested that intelligence-driven CND creates a strong security position by breaking the adversary's attack chain. Indicating that defenders do not have an inherent disadvantage against attackers if they can implement countermesures more rapidly than adversaries can adjust
- Intrusion Kill Chain: A concept brought from military doctrine, the intrusion kill chain is a process for targeting and engaging an enemy. It includes reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. The chain helps in understanding and disrupting the enemy's actions
- In the paper there are multiple possible courses of action outlined that correspond with different phases of the intrusion kill chain. These actions line up with the Department of Defense's information operations and include detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, and destroy. It is emphasized in the paper that a complete indicator utilization for resiliency is important, as it forces enemies to make more significant adjustments to achieve their goals.

Question/Comment: The paper presents a thorough approach to network defense utilizing the intrusion kill chain model. However, an area of further investigation could be the nature of adapting defensive strategies, considering that attackers are continually evolving their methods. How can defenders predict and prepare for the attacker's next steps, instead of always being reactive?
