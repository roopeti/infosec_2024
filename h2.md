## [The Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)

- The threat modeling manifesto says that threat modeling is the process of analyzing a system to identify potential security and privacy issues.
- The purpose is to recognize potential problems in a system and address design and implementation issues that need mitigation.
- Everyone who cares about the privacy, safety, and security of their system should perform threat modeling.
- The manifesto emphasizes values like a culture of finding and fixing issues, people and collaboration, and continuous understanding.
