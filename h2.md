## [The Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)

- The threat modeling manifesto says that threat modeling is the process of analyzing a system to identify potential security and privacy issues.
- The purpose is to recognize potential problems in a system and address design and implementation issues that need mitigation.
- Everyone who cares about the privacy, safety, and security of their system should perform threat modeling.
- The manifesto emphasizes values like a culture of finding and fixing issues, people and collaboration, and continuous understanding.

Question: How can a company make sure that everyone involved in a project undestands and participates in the threat modeling process?

## [Worlds shortest threat modeling course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf)

- The course is made by Adam Shostack, who is an expert in threat modeling and has written popular books on the subject.
- In the second video of the course Adam says that threat modeling is a method used to anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them, ideally before any code has been written or any physical components have been procured.
- The course introduces a four-question framework for threat modeling: What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good job?
- In order to sketch out the potential threats collaboration is emphazised.
- The course also covers data flow diagrams as a useful tool for undestanding what you're working on. The diagrams include five elements: external entities, processes, data flows, data stores, and trust boundaries.
- Sometimes in threat modeling all that is needed is a space for people to express their concerns. Other times, structures like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of privilege) can help guide answers.

Comment: It would be beneficial if there were more practical examples or case studies included in the course to show the concepts being taught.


## [Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model!](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/threat-modeling-designing/9781118810057/9781118810057c01.xhtml#c1)

- This is summary of Chapter 1 "Dive In and Threat Model!" by Adam Shostack.
- Chapter 1 outlines that threat modeling is a practical discipline that helps identify potential security issues in a system by stripping away details to see the bigger picture.
- It involves four key questions: What are you building? What can go wrong? What should you do about it? Did you do a decent job of analysis?
- The process begins with creating a diagram of the system, highlighting data flows, trust boundaries, and identifying potential threats using STRIDE.
- Once threats are identified, they must be addressed through mitigation, elimination, transfer, or acceptance.
- Each threat that is identified should be treated as a bug and managed accordingly withing the organization's existing bug-tracking process.
- In order to validate the threat model you must check the accuracy of the model against the built system, ensuring all threats have been considered and addressed. And confirmed that tests are in place for each threat.
- To develop skills it is essential to practice threat modeling on real systems.

Question and comment: The concept of treating identified threats as bugs is a smart way to integrate security considerations into existing development processes seamlessly. But how do you prioritize threats once they have been identified, especially when resources for mitigation are limited?

## [Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html)

- Benefits of threat modeling comprise of improved visibility of the system, increased security awareness, and early identification risks.
- The process of threat modeling can be broken down into four basic steps: application decomposition, threat identification and ranking, mitigations, and review and validation.
- Application decomposition requires understanding of the system being evaluated. This is where data flow diagrams come in handy.
- Mitigations ask what to do about each identified threat. Responses could include mitigating the threat, eliminating the feature causing the threat, transferring responsibility to another entity or accepting the risk.
- Review and validation answers whether a good enough job has been done in the threat modeling process.

Comment: Mitigation step is important since it requires deciding what actions to take against each threat. The different options of either mitigating, eliminating, transferring or accepting the risk deliver flexibility depending on the circumstance.
  
  Question: How do organizations decide which response is most appropriate for a particular threat?


# a) Security hygiene

### Basic security practices everyone should follow. 

- Update software regularly.
- Use unique and strong passwords: Avoid using passwords such as "123456" or "qwerty". Instead use combinations of letters, numbers, and special characters. Using a password manager is recommended.
- Consider using 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) where it is possible.
- Be watchful of phishing attempts: Don't click on suspicious links or download anything from unknown sources. Phishing emails can look like they're from legitimate companies.
- Use secure networks.
- Backup data regularly (I should do this more often).
- Limit personal information shared online.


# b) Make-belief threat model

1) What are we working on?

  The imaginary company is called "HealthSecure". This healthcare technology firm offers a virtual platform for patients and healthcare providers to communicate. HealthSecure provides services like online consultations, prescription renewals, and digital health records storage. 

  The Key Assets for HealthSecure are:
  - Patient personal information: Includes names, addresses, social security numbers, etc.
  - Patient health information: Comprised of medical history, diagnosis information, prescriptions, etc.
  - Software that runs the company's platform.
  - Servers where data is stored.

2) What can go wrong?

   I will use the STRIDE model to identify threats.

   Spoofing: An attacker could try to impersonate a doctor or patient to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
   
   Tampering: Data could be altered in transit or at rest.
   
   Repudiation: If there isn't proper logging and auditing, an attacker could perform malicious activities and deny them.
   
   Information Disclosure: Data could be leaked intentionally by an insider or unintentionally due to weak security controls.
   
   Denial of Service: The platform could be made unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic or exploiting a vulnerability.
   
   Elevation of Privilege: An attacker could exploit a vulnerability to gain higher privileges than intended.

   Biggest risks:
   - Data breach: Highest probability due to the sensitivity of the data and the possibly high value of the data.
   - Denial of service attack (DoS): Medium probability but high impact since it would disrupt the service resulting in financial loss and damage to the reputation of the company.
  
   Threat actors:
   - Criminals looking for valuable data to sell.
   - Groups who might target the company for political reasons.
   - Insider threats from employees.

4) What are we going to do about it?

   - In order to prevent spoofing and elevation of privilege attacks we are going to implement strong authentication and authorization controls.
   - To prevent disclosure and tampering the data needs to be encrypted in transit and at rest.
   - Implement proper logging and auditing mechanisms to prevent repudiation.
   - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential threats.
   - And lastly train employees on security awareness to reduce the risk of insider threats.
  
5) Did we do a good enough job?

   This could be evaluated through:
   - Regular security audits.
   - Penetration testing.
   - Continuous threat modeling.
   - Third-party assessments from security firms.
