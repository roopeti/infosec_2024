## [The Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)

- The threat modeling manifesto says that threat modeling is the process of analyzing a system to identify potential security and privacy issues.
- The purpose is to recognize potential problems in a system and address design and implementation issues that need mitigation.
- Everyone who cares about the privacy, safety, and security of their system should perform threat modeling.
- The manifesto emphasizes values like a culture of finding and fixing issues, people and collaboration, and continuous understanding.

Question: How can a company make sure that everyone involved in a project undestands and participates in the threat modeling process?

## [Worlds shortest threat modeling course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf)

- The course is made by Adam Shostack, who is an expert in threat modeling and has written popular books on the subject.
- In the second video of the course Adam says that threat modeling is a method used to anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them, ideally before any code has been written or any physical components have been procured.
- The course introduces a four-question framework for threat modeling: What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good job?
- In order to sketch out the potential threats collaboration is emphazised.
- The course also covers data flow diagrams as a useful tool for undestanding what you're working on. The diagrams include five elements: external entities, processes, data flows, data stores, and trust boundaries.
- Sometimes in threat modeling all that is needed is a space for people to express their concerns. Other times, structures like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of privilege) can help guide answers.

Comment: It would be beneficial if there were more practical examples or case studies included in the course to show the concepts being taught.
