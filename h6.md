- Tor still remains effective at maintaining user anonymity.
- Tor is used by many different kinds of people, such as activists, journalists, militaries, families, and of course criminals.
- The Tor Project was initally funded by the US Navy. It is open-source, meaning it has been audited by many people to ensure a backdoor doesn't exist.
- Even though Tor is a privacy browser, it can be used by anyone since it is user-friendly.
- While Tor is slower than a conventional internet browser, its speed has increased over time.
- Tor is not foolproof and if you use it incorrectly, you can compromise your anonymity. It's important to keep the software up to date and understand that logging into services such as Facebook over Tor doesn't keep those communications anonymous.
