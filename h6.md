### [7 Things You Should Know About Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)

- Tor still remains effective at maintaining user anonymity.
- Tor is used by many different kinds of people, such as activists, journalists, militaries, families, and of course criminals.
- The Tor Project was initally funded by the US Navy. It is open-source, meaning it has been audited by many people to ensure a backdoor doesn't exist.
- Even though Tor is a privacy browser, it can be used by anyone since it is user-friendly.
- While Tor is slower than a conventional internet browser, its speed has increased over time.
- Tor is not foolproof and if you use it incorrectly, you can compromise your anonymity. It's important to keep the software up to date and understand that logging into services such as Facebook over Tor doesn't keep those communications anonymous.


###  [Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hiding-behind-the/9780128033524/XHTML/B9780128033401000021/B9780128033401000021.xhtml#s0065)

- The Onion Router, known as Tor, is a way to anonymously browse the internet. It hides the user's IP address, making it difficult to trace or identify the user.
- Even though Tor was initially developed by the US government, it is now maintained by a community of privacy-focused experts across the globe.
- The way it works is: Tor browser directs a user's Internet traffic through random relays on the Internet, each layer of encryption is stripped at each relay, making the original source of the data difficult to trace.
- Tor can be a valuable tool for privacy and freedom of speech, but it is also used by criminals for criminal activities, such as trafficking drugs or weapons.
- For this reason governments are looking for ways to deanonymize Tor to find criminals or prevent criminal activity.
- Obtaining the true IP address of a user can still be possible even if they are using Tor, but only if the user makes a mistake. An example of this would be customizing the browser settings that can leak information.


## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network

Since I already had the Tor browser installed I didn't install it, but I will still go through the steps that it would take to install Tor and browse the net.

First you would go to [this](https://www.torproject.org/download/) website, and download the browser for Windows.
After that you would run the installer and install the browser. 

Once installed I ran the browser and this is what it looks like:

You need to press 'Connect'. After which the browser establishes a connection.
Using DuckDuckGo, which is the default search engine for the Tor browser. I searched for "Hidden wiki", and I chose [this](https://thehiddenwiki.org/) website from the results. On this website there are multiple different website addresses ending in .onion. 
Since there are so many of these so called "Hidden Wiki" links when you search for it on DuckDuckGo, there could be phising links on these websites. Since I am not actually going to be buying or selling anything on these websites it doesn't really matter in this case. 
But anyway, this is what it looks like:

And I think that it goes without saying that most of the activities that these links contain are illegal. 


## b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment

I chose to use the default search engine DuckDuckGo, since it seems good. Now using some previous knowledge I searched for "Punainen Kolmio", this is a blog written by Aarno Malin. It is a blog about drugs and different news on the finnish darknet.
Here is a screenshot of the blog:

There is a post about the newest finnish darknet market and a link to be able to access it:

In order to actually browse the market you'd need to make an account. Also to make sure that you are not being phished the website has a photo that tells you what the link should look like. 
I won't make an account since I have no interest in actually using the market, since it is illegal.

Now regarding a forum. I chose a finnish forum called "Suomiskene". This is what it looks like: 

![image](https://github.com/roopeti/infosec_2024/assets/113911074/790745ba-db33-48e7-998d-3e9449243d8f)

It is a forum, where you can discuss anything, but you can not sell or buy anything illegal. 
The way that I found the forum was through ylilauta, which is a finnish clearnet forum.
Often there is conversation on these forums that can't be had on the clearnet, so usually relating to drugs and other illegal activities. 


For a well known organization I chose ProPublica, which does investigative journalism. This is the onion address for their website: "http://p53lf57qovyuvwsc6xnrppyply3vtqm7l6pcobkmyqsiofyeznfu5uqd.onion/"

Here is a screenshot of the onion website:
