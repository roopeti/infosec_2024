### [A05: Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

- Misconfiguration has moved up to #5 from #6 in the previous edition. 90% of applications were tested for misconfiguration, with an average incident rate of 4%.
- Vulnerabilities include missing security hardening, improperly configured permissions, enabled unnecessary features, unchanged default accountsm and passwords, overly informative error messages, insecurely configured security features, lack of security headers or directives, or outdated software
- Prevention methods include secure installation processes, a repeatable hardening process, minimal platform, updating configurations, segmented application architecture, sending security directives, and an automated process to verify configurations and settings.
- Example attack scenarios include compromise through sample applications, directory listing, detailed error messages, and default sharing permissions open to the Internet.

### [A03: Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)

- Injection vulnerabilities have slipped to the third spot in the list.
- 94% of applications were tested for some form of injection, with a 19% maximum incident rate and a 3% average rate.
- An application is vulnerable to attack when user-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.
- Common types of injection include SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping, LDAP, and Expression Language or Object Navigation Library injection.
- To prevent injection, it's recommended to keep data separate from commands and queries, use a safe API, use positive server-side input validation, escape special characters, use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries.
- In the example attack scenarios, the application uses untrusted data in the construction of vulnerable SQL calls, which an attacker can manipulate to extract sensitive information or manipulate data.
