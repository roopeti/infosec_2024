### [A05: Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

- Misconfiguration has moved up to #5 from #6 in the previous edition. 90% of applications were tested for misconfiguration, with an average incident rate of 4%.
- Vulnerabilities include missing security hardening, improperly configured permissions, enabled unnecessary features, unchanged default accountsm and passwords, overly informative error messages, insecurely configured security features, lack of security headers or directives, or outdated software
- Prevention methods include secure installation processes, a repeatable hardening process, minimal platform, updating configurations, segmented application architecture, sending security directives, and an automated process to verify configurations and settings.
- Example attack scenarios include compromise through sample applications, directory listing, detailed error messages, and default sharing permissions open to the Internet.

### [A03: Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)

- Injection vulnerabilities have slipped to the third spot in the list.
- 94% of applications were tested for some form of injection, with a 19% maximum incident rate and a 3% average rate.
- An application is vulnerable to attack when user-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.
- Common types of injection include SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping, LDAP, and Expression Language or Object Navigation Library injection.
- To prevent injection, it's recommended to keep data separate from commands and queries, use a safe API, use positive server-side input validation, escape special characters, use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries.
- In the given attack scenarios the application utilizes data to create SQL queries. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the data to either extract information or tamper with the existing data.

Comment: Interesting to see how pervasive injection vulnerabilities are, despite being such a well-known issue.

### [A06: Vulnerable and outdated components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)

- Vulnerable components are a known issue with significant risk, these include both server-side and client-side components.
- Components can be vulnerable if they are outdated, unsupported, or if they have not been tested or scanned for vulnerabilities regularly.
- If these components aren't fixed or upgraded in a timely manner, they can expose organizations to vulnerabilities for days or months.
- Developers should test the compatibility of updated libraries and secure components' configurations.
- To prevent vulnerabilities, organizations should have a patch management process in place, remove unused dependencies, monitor for security vulnerabilities, obtain components from official sources, and monitor libraries and components that are unmaintained.
- Automated tools such as Shodan IoT search engine can help attackers find vulnerable systems.

Question: Given that these vulnerabilities are so serious, are there more proactive mesures that can be taken to prevent them, other than regular updates and scans?

## b) F12. Solve Webgoat 2023.4: General: Developer tools.

In this task I am to solve the tasks in the WebGoat General: Developer tools.

First I navigate to the Developer tools: ![image](https://github.com/roopeti/infosec_2024/assets/113911074/ef1a0281-8237-49f5-9acb-b0967568145f)

I complete the "Hello World!": ![image](https://github.com/roopeti/infosec_2024/assets/113911074/ee7a8176-b7c8-4b1f-9a2d-412228df2c69)

I complete the next assignment by pasting some code into the browser console: ![image](https://github.com/roopeti/infosec_2024/assets/113911074/78276676-4204-4965-8f4a-b45e500d7cd1)

Next I complete the Network tab task: First I press the "Go!" button ![image](https://github.com/roopeti/infosec_2024/assets/113911074/61d2e42a-75f7-490a-9993-1765266193f3)

Then I navigate to the Network tab in the developer tools: ![image](https://github.com/roopeti/infosec_2024/assets/113911074/f9055c5e-2a44-420f-b954-4f708b6a0907)
Then I find the POST request from the list: ![image](https://github.com/roopeti/infosec_2024/assets/113911074/012d5ad4-041c-4440-9bca-fb5b42c51100)

I click on the request and copy paste the number into the field: ![image](https://github.com/roopeti/infosec_2024/assets/113911074/015e01a7-77c2-40f0-9a7d-040a1e0e1bb1)

## c) Not outdated. Update all operating system and all applications in your Linux.

I use this command in the terminal to update all operating system and all applications: sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade

## d) Sequel. Solve [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial):

- 0 SELECT basics

First one:
